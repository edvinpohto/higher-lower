The application uses modules, and can therefore not be viewed by simply opening
the index.html file in a browser.

Here are instructions for how to set up a node.js and Express local server to interact
with the application in.

1. Install and initialise node.js on your computer. https://nodejs.org/en/ 
2. In the submission directory, run: 'npm install'
3. Finally, in the same directory as you ran the previous, start the server by 
running: 'node server.js'

To access the server and the submission, navigate to http://localhost:3000//
in your web browser.
